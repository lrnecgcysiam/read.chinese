### Reading in Chinese

### Why this is important

Learning a new topic is very difficult only when you think about 
everything you need to do to get that specific task completed.
In reality though you will only be able to do so much at a single time.

The key is to remember that you need to focus on the TASK everyday no matter 
how much you think it will take to eventually get done.

### Note

Try to remember to stop after sometime because you might need to work on 
other tasks. as little as 25 minutes is a decent enough of time to start with


### Using a version control system like git

Git is a version control system and it allows a user to keep track of CHANGES within the
repository which is just a folder of files.

Keep your work public but not so easy to find and share the repository through other means.
